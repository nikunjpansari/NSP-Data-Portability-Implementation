# Data Portability Implementation on National Scholarship Portal 2.0

This repository contains the implementation of data portability on the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) 2.0. Data portability enables users to transfer their scholarship-related data from NSP to other platforms or services seamlessly. This implementation aims to provide users with more control over their data and promote interoperability.

## Overview

The National Scholarship Portal 2.0 is an online platform that facilitates the application, processing, and management of scholarships offered by various government agencies. The data portability implementation on NSP 2.0 allows users to extract their scholarship data in a standardized format, making it easier for them to migrate their data to other platforms or analyze it independently.

## Features

The data portability implementation offers the following features:

1. **Data Extraction :** Users can request their scholarship data to be exported in a portable format, such as JSON or CSV.
2. **Selective Export :** Users have the option to select specific data categories or time periods for export.
3. **Secure Authentication :** Export requests are authenticated using the user's NSP credentials to ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Asynchronous Export :** Large data exports are processed asynchronously to prevent timeouts and ensure a smooth user experience.
5. **Error Handling :** The implementation includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle any issues that may arise during the export process.

## Installation
